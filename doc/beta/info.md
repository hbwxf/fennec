# Fennec Beta Guide
## Getting started
### How to access Fennec?
Open <http://132.187.21.191> in your webbrowser (only accessible from the university of WÃ¼rzburg network).

### Where to get demo data?
- Pollen data Jonathan: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molbiodiv/fennec/beta/doc/beta/J.biom>
- Pollen data Nadja: <https://raw.githubusercontent.com/molbiodiv/fennec/beta/doc/beta/N.biom>

### General remarks:
 - Use Fennec with the demo data to perform the tasks explained below
 - If you can't perform one of the tasks don't hesitate to ask me for assistance
 - If you have ideas for improvement, missing features or missing traits report them via [https://github.com/molbiodiv/fennec/issues](https://github.com/molbiodiv/fennec/issues)
 - If you find something counter-intuitive or awkward report it as well
 - I will try to give very quick feedback via github and implement suggested improvements constantly
 - This first beta phase ends at the 12th of May
 
## Tasks
 - Explore the existing traits
 - Search for some organisms (plants)
 - Log in via Github (Google is currently not working)
 - Upload one of the demo data sets into Fennec
 - Map the demo data set via NCBI Id
 - Add some of the traits to the project
 - Explore the trait composition with the integrated Phinch
 - Try to spot interesting trait patterns in the demo data (best case: suitable for a case study in the publication)
 - Export the enriched community data
 - Load into any external analysis program
 - Try to import your own (project) data into fennec
 
## Feedback
Answer this questions after thourough testing:

 - What would be required to make it usable for you?
 - What features are most sorely missing?
 - What can be done to make working with Fennec more intuitive?
 - Do you feel comfortable using traits from Fennec for own publications?
 - Would you consider adding your own trait data to a public instance of Fennec?

Thanks!
