The boxes show the number of organisms and trait entries in the current database.
You can explore the organisms and traits in the database by using the navigation on the left hand side.
However, in order to analyze projects it is necessary to log in (in the top right corner).
You can login using your GitHub or Google account.
Some instances also provide a demo user (look on the page for information).

After login navigate to projects.
If it is your first login the project table will be empty.
Otherwise your projects show up here.
To upload a new project in biom format just click the ``Browse`` Button and select the file.
